# Print View Implementation Plan

## Objectives
- Provide meeting-ready daily, weekly, and monthly schedule print views that match the agreed wireframes.
- Keep the live dashboard unchanged while offering a dedicated `/print` workflow that users can launch, review, and send to the printer (or system PDF).
- Ensure data accuracy and performance by reusing existing scheduling APIs where possible and adding targeted endpoints only when detail levels differ.

## Phase 1 – Preparation
1. **Confirm data fields**: Verify day/week/month data points (bay, vehicle model, priority, alerts, summaries) with operations lead.
2. **Audit current API coverage**: Document what schedule endpoints exist, their response shapes, and any gaps versus the new layouts.
3. **Design specs**: Translate the textual drafts into low-fidelity mockups (Figma or whiteboard) and capture layout spacing, typography, and responsive breakpoints (desktop + print portrait/landscape).
4. **Identify dependencies**: Note any required libraries (e.g., `@react-pdf/renderer` if reconsidered later) and confirm print CSS strategy (pure CSS vs. component-level tweaks).

## Phase 2 – Backend Updates
1. **Data contracts**
   - Day view: endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/schedule/day?date=`) returns ordered jobs with bay, vehicle model, priority, customer contact, alerts, bay utilization stats, notes.
   - Week view: endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/schedule/week?start=`) returns day buckets, time-of-day groupings, job metadata, workload rollups, alerts.
   - Month view: endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/schedule/month?month=`) returns major jobs, deadlines, PTO blocks, upcoming events, summary metrics.
2. **Normalization helpers**: Add shared utilities (e.g., `/server/services/schedule/printTransform.ts`) to shape raw DB rows into print-ready structures.
3. **Caching & batching**: For monthly summaries, introduce query caching (Redis/in-memory) or batched DB queries to avoid redundant calculations.
4. **Access control**: Ensure print endpoints respect existing auth (token/session) and add audit logging if prints should be tracked.
5. **Testing**: Add server-side unit tests for transformers and integration tests for each new endpoint to verify required fields and ordering.

## Phase 3 – Frontend Implementation
1. **Routing & state**
   - Add a dedicated route (e.g., `/print-schedule`) with query params `view=day|week|month` and date selectors.
   - Integrate with existing state management (Redux/Zustand/Query) to fetch print endpoints; add loading & error fallbacks optimized for print.
2. **Layout components**
   - Create `PrintLayout` shell component with shared header, quick stats, notes section container, and print-friendly typography.
   - Implement subcomponents: `DayPrintView`, `WeekPrintView`, `MonthPrintView`, each rendering the exact grid structures from the drafts.
   - Include vehicle model inline where required and replace tech info with bay assignments.
3. **Styling & print CSS**
   - Add scoped CSS (Tailwind or CSS modules) that targets `@media print` to enforce page breaks, hide navigation chrome, and adjust colors for grayscale legibility.
   - Ensure layouts collapse gracefully for portrait/landscape options; add `page-break-inside: avoid` for multi-row tables.
4. **Controls & UX**
   - Provide top-level controls: date picker(s), view toggle tabs, `Print` button invoking `window.print()`, and optional “Open in new tab” to print-only view.
   - Add helper text reminding users they can use system PDF printing if needed.
5. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure headings follow semantic order and tables include `thead`/`tbody` for screen reader support (helps digital archive users).

## Phase 4 – QA & Validation
1. **Cross-browser print testing**: Verify in Chrome, Edge, Firefox (and iOS/Android if tablets are used in meetings) for paper sizes Letter & A4.
2. **Data accuracy checks**: Compare print view totals against dashboard totals for sample days/weeks to confirm transformations.
3. **Performance review**: Monitor network calls; ensure large month requests stay within acceptable latency (<1s target).
4. **User sign-off**: Conduct walkthrough with staff; collect adjustments to column widths, copy, or emphasis.

## Phase 5 – Launch & Follow-up
1. **Documentation**: Update README or internal wiki with instructions (`/print-schedule`, required permissions, troubleshooting print margins).
2. **Feature flag (optional)**: Roll out behind a toggle for soft launch; monitor usage analytics.
3. **Post-launch tasks**: Track change requests for future iterations (e.g., reinstating tech column, optional PDF export library, or saved presets).
4. **Maintenance**: Set reminder to revisit print view whenever schedule schema changes to prevent drift.
